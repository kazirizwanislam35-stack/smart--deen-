    <h1>Prophet Ṣāliḥ (A.S)</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">Messenger to the People of Thamūd • A Call to Righteousness</div>


    <h2>The Story of Prophet Ṣāliḥ (A.S)</h2>
    <p>
        Prophet Ṣāliḥ (A.S) was sent to the ancient tribe of <b>Thamūd</b>, a powerful nation that lived
        after the people of ‘Ād. They were gifted with extraordinary skill:  
        they carved magnificent homes into mountains,  
        built monumental palaces from solid rock,  
        and engineered structures with brilliance unmatched in their time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Their land was lush, open, and thriving — a place filled with gardens, springs, and endless comfort.
        Yet despite these countless blessings, the people of Thamūd gradually slipped into arrogance.
    </p>

    <p>
        They worshiped idols carved by their own hands,  
        trusted their strength more than Allah,  
        and believed their stone fortresses made them invincible.
    </p>

    <p>
        Among them lived Ṣāliḥ (A.S) — the most noble, intelligent, pure-hearted man of his tribe.
        He was widely respected and admired long before his prophethood.
        Their elders would say:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="opacity:0.8; font-style:italic;">
        “Ṣāliḥ is the hope of our people. He will one day lead us.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        But once Allah appointed him as a Messenger and he called them to worship Allah alone,
        everything changed.
    </p>

    <p>
        They mocked him, accused him of lying, and even called him:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="opacity:0.8; font-style:italic;">
        “A man who was once wise has now become bewitched!”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Yet Ṣāliḥ (A.S) remained patient, calm, and filled with compassion.
        His message was simple, pure, and universal:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="color:#00e89a; font-weight:600;">
        “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god other than Him.”
    </blockquote>

        <div class="reflection-title">Smart Deen Reflection:</div>
        <p>
            Guidance is a blessing — but only for the heart that is willing to soften.
            Arrogance blinds even the most intelligent.
            Humility opens the doors to truth.
        </p>
    </div>



    <h2>The Miracle of the She-Camel</h2>

    <p>
        As the people continued rejecting him, they demanded a miracle — not just any miracle,
        but something impossible according to their own minds.
    </p>

    <p>
        They pointed to a giant rock and said:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="opacity:0.8; font-style:italic;">
        “If you can bring out from this rock a living she-camel — pregnant, strong, and unique —
        then we will believe you.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Ṣāliḥ (A.S) warned them:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="opacity:0.8; font-style:italic;">
        “If Allah brings out what you ask, will you truly believe?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        They swore an oath.  
        The earth trembled.  
        The rock cracked open.  
        And by the command of Allah, a magnificent she-camel emerged.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was unlike any animal they had ever seen — huge, graceful, majestic.
        It was a sign so clear that no one could deny its divine origin.
    </p>

    <p>
        The miracle came with instructions:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The camel would drink from the well on certain days.</li>
        <li>The people would drink on the alternate days.</li>
        <li>They were forbidden from harming her.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The believers rejoiced.  
        The disbelievers were shaken.
    </p>


    <h2>The Plot Against the Camel</h2>

    <p>
        As time passed, envy grew in their hearts.
        The camel became a living reminder of their failure to challenge Allah,
        and a symbol of truth they hated to see every day.
    </p>

    <p>
        A group of nine criminals — the worst of Thamūd —
        secretly gathered and formed a plan to kill the camel.
    </p>

    <p>
        They attacked her brutally and slaughtered her.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the news reached Ṣāliḥ (A.S), grief filled his voice:
    </p>

    <blockquote style="opacity:0.8; font-style:italic;">
        “You have committed a terrible crime.  
        Enjoy your homes for three days — this is a promise that will not be denied.”
    </blockquote>

        <div class="reflection-title">Smart Deen Reflection:</div>
        <p>
            When a heart rejects truth, it does not stop at disbelief —
            it begins to fight the truth itself.
            Sin grows when left unchecked.
        </p>
    </div>



    <h2>The Punishment</h2>

    <p>
        Day 1 — their faces turned yellow.  
        Day 2 — their faces turned red.  
        Day 3 — their faces turned black.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fear overtook them.  
        On the morning of the fourth day, a mighty earthquake struck their land,
        followed by a scream so powerful that their souls were seized instantly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Their mighty stone houses protected no one.
    </p>

    <p>
        Except for the small group of believers —  
        they were saved by Allah’s mercy.
    </p>


    <h2>The Lessons from Thamūd</h2>

    <p>
        The story of Ṣāliḥ (A.S) teaches us:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>No nation is destroyed without clear warnings.</li>
        <li>Arrogance blinds the heart more than any physical darkness.</li>
        <li>Signs from Allah appear every day — but only the humble recognize them.</li>
        <li>Material power is useless without faith.</li>
        <li>Disobedience begins small but ends in destruction.</li>
    </ul>


    <div class="card">
        <div class="reflection-title">Smart Deen Reflection:</div>
        <p>
            A believer is not measured by strength or wealth,
            but by how quickly he responds to truth.
            Every moment contains a reminder —
            for those who listen with the heart.
