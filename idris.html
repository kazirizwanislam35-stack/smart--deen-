        <h2>Prophet Idris (A.S) — Full Story</h2>

        <p>
            Prophet Idris (A.S), peace be upon him, stands among the earliest prophets in human
            history, following Prophet Adam (A.S) and Prophet Sheeth (A.S). He is honored in the
            Qur’an as a man of truth and patience, and his life serves as a remarkable example of
            devotion, wisdom, and steadfastness. Idris (A.S) is believed to be the first person to
            write with a pen, sew clothes, and study astronomy — truly a pioneer in human civilization.
        </p>

        <p>
            Allah elevated him to a high station, a unique honor mentioned in the Qur’an. His ascension
            reflects his extraordinary faith and obedience. Idris (A.S) spent his life calling people
            toward goodness, teaching them divine knowledge, and encouraging righteous living.
        </p>

        <h2>Wisdom, Knowledge, and Revelation</h2>
        <p>
            Idris (A.S) received divine scriptures and was known for his deep reflection on the mysteries
            of creation. He was the first to understand the movements of stars and the measurement of time.
            His intellect and prophetic insight helped guide early communities toward structure, discipline,
            and moral conduct.
        </p>

        <h2>Ascension to the Heavens</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most extraordinary aspects of his life is his ascension. Allah says:
            <br><br>
            <i>“And We raised him to a high station.”</i>
            <br><br>
            Scholars interpret this as a spiritual elevation, a physical ascension, or both. This honor
            symbolizes his closeness to Allah and his elevated spiritual rank among prophets.
        </p>

        <h2>His Legacy for Believers</h2>
        <p>
            Prophet Idris (A.S) left behind a legacy of patience, faith, reflection, and the pursuit
            of knowledge. His example teaches believers to seek wisdom, remain steadfast in trials,
            and live with discipline and sincerity.
        </p>

        <div class="reflection-box">
            <b>Reflection:</b><br><br>
            Consider how patience strengthens your faith. Think of a moment when you remained calm
            during difficulty — how did it bring you closer to Allah? Write a short reflection on
            how you can adopt Idris’s qualities of wisdom, discipline, and gratitude.
