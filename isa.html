    <h1>Prophet Isa (AS)</h1>
</div>

<!-- Main Story -->
<div class="section">
    <div class="headline">Birth of a Miracle</div>
    <p>
        The story of Isa (AS) begins with one of the greatest miracles in history.
        Maryam (AS), a woman of unmatched purity, was chosen by Allah to give birth
        to a child without a father. Angels brought her the glad tidings:
        “O Maryam, Allah gives you news of a word from Him, whose name is Isa,
        the Messiah.” Isa (AS) was born pure, protected, and chosen.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <div class="headline">Speaking in the Cradle</div>
    <p>
        When Maryam (AS) returned to her people with baby Isa (AS), they accused her
        of wrongdoing. To defend her, the infant Isa (AS) spoke as a newborn — a miracle
        granted only to him. He declared:
        “I am the servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet.”
        This moment silenced the people and proved the purity of both Isa (AS) and his mother.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <div class="headline">Signs and Miracles</div>
    <p>
        Allah gave Isa (AS) miracles unlike any other Prophet:
        <br>• healing the blind and leper  
        <br>• giving life to the dead  
        <br>• creating a bird from clay and giving it life  
        <br>• revealing what people stored in their homes
        <br><br>
        All by Allah’s permission — not by Isa (AS) himself — to guide Bani Isra’il back
        to the truth.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <div class="headline">The Message of Tawheed</div>
    <p>
        Isa (AS) came to correct the corruption that had spread among the children of Israel.
        He reminded them:
        <br><br>
        “Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.”
        <br><br>
        But instead of accepting, many rejected him while others exaggerated and raised him
        above what he was — a noble Prophet and servant of Allah.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <div class="headline">The Plot to Kill Him</div>
    <p>
        As Isa (AS)'s message spread, jealousy grew among the leaders. They plotted to kill him.
        But Allah protected him. A man who betrayed Isa (AS) was made to look like him and was
        taken instead. Isa (AS) was raised up alive to the heavens — not killed, not crucified.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <div class="headline">Isa (AS) Will Return</div>
    <p>
        One of the greatest events of the end times will be the return of Isa (AS).
        He will descend again, break the cross, kill the Dajjal, restore justice,
        and rule with peace. His return will be a sign of truth and unity.
    </p>

    <div class="card-title">Smart Deen Reflections</div>
    <p>
        • Stay humble — even Isa (AS) called himself a servant of Allah.  
        • Truth will always shine, even when people try to hide it.  
        • Miracles don’t make a person divine; they point to Allah’s power.  
        • Patience in the face of lies and jealousy brings Allah’s protection.  
        • Remember: Isa (AS)’s return reminds us to stay prepared spiritually.
