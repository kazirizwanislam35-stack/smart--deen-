    <h1>Prophet Mūsā (A.S)</h1>
    <p>Messenger to Egypt • Destroyer of Pharaoh’s tyranny • Leader of Banī Isrā’īl</p>

    <div class="container">

        <h3>The Beginning — A Miracle in a Cradle</h3>
        <p>
            Prophet Mūsā (A.S) was born during a time when Pharaoh had ordered the killing of every 
            newborn boy among Banī Isrā’īl. His birth itself was a miracle, protected by Allah’s plan.
            When the soldiers searched houses, Allah inspired his mother:
        </p>

        <p><i>“Place him in a basket and set him afloat upon the river.”</i></p>

        <p>
            The basket sailed through the Nile — not by the river’s will, but by Allah’s command — 
            until it reached Pharaoh’s palace. There, Baby Mūsā was lifted from the water and 
            adopted by the very tyrant who sought his death.
        </p>

        <div class="reflection">
            <b>Smart Deen Reflection:</b><br>
            When the world closes all doors, Allah opens rivers. Never think you are trapped — 
            your rescue may come from the place you fear the most.
        </div>

        <h3>Mūsā in Pharaoh’s Palace — Raised by the Enemy</h3>
        <p>
            Mūsā (A.S) grew up in luxury, educated among nobles, yet he never forgot his identity. 
            Allah shaped him through wisdom, courage, grace, and justice.
        </p>

        <p>
            One day, he intervened in a fight between an Israelite and an Egyptian guard. 
            He struck the guard and the man died accidentally — a test, not a crime.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fearing Pharaoh’s wrath, Mūsā fled Egypt, leaving behind royalty for the hardship of the desert.
        </p>

        <div class="reflection">
            <b>Smart Deen Reflection:</b><br>
            Growth sometimes requires leaving comfort. Allah pushes His chosen people out of palaces 
            so they can rise into prophethood.
        </div>

        <h3>The Sacred Call — Fire on Mount Ṭūr</h3>
        <p>
            In Madyan, Mūsā built a new life, marrying and working as a shepherd. 
            Years later, as he traveled back toward Egypt, he saw a glowing fire on Mount Ṭūr.  
        </p>

        <p>There, Allah spoke to him directly — an honor given to no one before.</p>

        <p><b>“O Mūsā, I have chosen you. Go to Pharaoh — for he has transgressed.”</b></p>

        <p>
            With a staff that transformed into a serpent and a hand that shone with divine light, 
            Mūsā returned to challenge the tyrant.
        </p>

        <div class="reflection">
            <b>Smart Deen Reflection:</b><br>
            When Allah gives you a mission, He gives you the tools. Never fear what He sends you toward.
        </div>

        <h3>The Confrontation — Truth vs Tyranny</h3>
        <p>
            Mūsā and Hārūn (A.S) stood before Pharaoh’s throne. The court magicians mocked them until 
            they witnessed the miracle of Mūsā’s staff swallowing their illusions.  
        </p>

        <p>
            They fell into sujood instantly — choosing truth over power, faith over fear.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pharaoh’s arrogance rose, and he intensified his oppression of Banī Isrā’īl. 
            After years of rejection, Allah commanded Mūsā to lead his people out of Egypt.
        </p>

        <div class="reflection">
            <b>Smart Deen Reflection:</b><br>
            Real power is not in palaces or armies. It is in the heart that bows to Allah even in front of a tyrant.
        </div>

        <h3>The Red Sea — The Miracle of Liberation</h3>
        <p>
            With Pharaoh’s army chasing them, Banī Isrā’īl reached the Red Sea. 
            The people panicked — the ocean ahead, soldiers behind.
        </p>

        <p>
            But Mūsā (A.S) remained unshaken:
        </p>

        <p><b>“My Lord is with me — He will guide me.”</b></p>

        <p>
            Allah commanded him to strike the sea with his staff.  
            The water split into towering walls, and a dry path opened miraculously.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mūsā and his people crossed safely. When Pharaoh entered the sea with his army, 
            the waters collapsed, ending the greatest tyranny in history.
        </p>

        <div class="reflection">
            <b>Smart Deen Reflection:</b><br>
            Faith turns oceans into roads. The moment you trust Allah fully, the impossible becomes easy.
        </div>

        <h3>After the Escape — Trials of Banī Isrā’īl</h3>
        <p>
            After liberation, Mūsā (A.S) guided his people through desert hardships. 
            They witnessed miracles — heavenly food, water from a rock, shade in the desert — yet many still complained.
        </p>

        <p>
            Their greatest test came when Mūsā went to Mount Sinai to speak with Allah for forty days.  
            In his absence, some people worshipped a golden calf — forgetting everything Allah had done for them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mūsā returned heartbroken but firm, restoring belief among his people.
        </p>

        <div class="reflection">
            <b>Smart Deen Reflection:</b><br>
            Gratitude is not proven by miracles — it is proven by loyalty.  
            Faith must survive even when things don’t go your way.
        </div>

        <h3>The Legacy of Mūsā (A.S)</h3>
        <p>
            Prophet Mūsā (A.S) is one of the greatest prophets, mentioned more than any other in the Qur’an.  
            His life teaches courage, patience, leadership, and trust in Allah beyond all limits.
        </p>

        <p>
            From a baby in a basket to a prophet who spoke to Allah — the journey of Mūsā (A.S) 
            is one of the most powerful reminders of Allah’s plan.
        </p>

            Never judge your beginning — Allah may be preparing you for a mission greater than you imagine.
